# ChargeQuest Development Logs

*Weekly captain's logs documenting the development journey of ChargeQuest - the EV charging treasure hunt game.*

## Week 1.0 - Mission Initiated & Technical Foundation

**Captain's Log, ChargeQuest Development, Week 1.0**

*"Mission Status: Initiated and technical foundation established. Starting an ambitious project to transform the EV charging experience in Stockholm.*

*Initial research reveals something interesting: EV drivers in Sweden only use public charging stations a handful of times per year. There are loads of charging stations throughout Stockholm, yet most drivers stick to the same familiar locations.*

*Working hypothesis: What if we could make discovering charging stations as engaging as a treasure hunt? Planning a 'fog-of-war' map approach - areas unlock only when you actually visit them.*

*Technical breakthrough: Successfully established our development environment. React Native with Expo Go is now configured with TypeScript support. The beauty of this setup is immediate - code changes reflect instantly on device through the Expo Go app. No complex native builds required for early development.*

*Engineering notes: Project initialized as 'chargequest-app' with proper version control in place. The blank TypeScript template gives us a clean foundation without unnecessary boilerplate. Integration path to Nobil API for real-time charging station data is clear.*

*Strategic decision: Building this mission in public through these weekly Captain's Logs. Transparency breeds accountability, and the EV community deserves to see how we're solving their charging discovery problem.*

*Personal note: I've never built a mobile app before, but watching 'Hello World' render on my phone felt like magic. If we can increase charging frequency by just 25%, it becomes a clear business case for charge point operators.*

*Mission objective: Prove that gamification drives measurable behavior change in EV charging habits.*

*Next phase: Begin core map functionality and establish connection to charging station data sources.*

*End log."*

## Week 2.0 - Playable Prototype & Visual Identity Established

**Captain's Log, ChargeQuest Development, Week 2.0**

*"Mission Status: Breakthrough achieved. We've transformed from concept to playable prototype with a distinct visual identity.*

*Technical victory: Core map functionality is operational. React Native Maps integration successful with user location tracking, adaptive zoom based on energy cell proximity, and robust state management through Zustand with persistence. The 25-meter discovery radius creates the perfect balance of challenge and accessibility.*

*Visual breakthrough: Committed to 8-bit pixel art aesthetic throughout the entire experience. Custom CSS pixel art character (inspired by Minecraft Steve), energy crystals with conditional sizing, and UI elements all maintain consistent 3px-per-pixel resolution. This isn't just styling - it's establishing ChargeQuest's unique gaming identity.*

*Geographic focus: Concentrated testing area in Töjnan neighborhood, Sollentuna. Nine strategically placed energy cells from Hjortvägen to Circle K Gas Station. This focused approach allows thorough testing of game mechanics before expanding coverage.*

*Game mechanics evolution: Implemented sophisticated claiming system with modern popover UX. Single tap opens location-specific popover, swipe-to-claim action with haptic feedback, instant state transitions. Much more satisfying than repetitive tapping mechanics.*

*Fog of war achievement: Successfully created atmospheric map darkening that enhances the treasure hunt feeling without complex SVG masking. Discovered locations remain visible while unexplored areas feel mysterious.*

*User experience insight: Modern mobile users expect polished interactions. The popover claiming system feels natural and professional - exactly what's needed to differentiate from basic location apps.*

*Business validation: Every technical decision reinforces the core hypothesis that gamification increases charging station discovery. The 8-bit aesthetic makes this feel like an actual game, not just another utility app.*

*Personal reflection: Building pixel art with CSS taught me that constraints breed creativity. The technical limitations forced elegant solutions that actually improved the user experience.*

*Next phase: Ready for first real-world testing. Need to validate that the discovery mechanics create genuine excitement when approaching actual charging stations.*

*End log."*
