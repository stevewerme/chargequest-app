## Week 1.0 - Mission Initiated & Technical Foundation

**Captain's Log, ChargeQuest Development, Week 1.0**

*"Mission Status: Initiated and technical foundation established. Starting an ambitious project to transform the EV charging experience in Stockholm.*

*Initial research reveals something interesting: EV drivers in Sweden only use public charging stations a handful of times per year. There are loads of charging stations throughout Stockholm, yet most drivers stick to the same familiar locations.*

*Working hypothesis: What if we could make discovering charging stations as engaging as a treasure hunt? Planning a 'fog-of-war' map approach - areas unlock only when you actually visit them.*

*Technical breakthrough: Successfully established our development environment. React Native with Expo Go is now configured with TypeScript support. The beauty of this setup is immediate - code changes reflect instantly on device through the Expo Go app. No complex native builds required for early development.*

*Engineering notes: Project initialized as 'chargequest-app' with proper version control in place. The blank TypeScript template gives us a clean foundation without unnecessary boilerplate. Integration path to Nobil API for real-time charging station data is clear.*

*Strategic decision: Building this mission in public through these weekly Captain's Logs. Transparency breeds accountability, and the EV community deserves to see how we're solving their charging discovery problem.*

*Personal note: I've never built a mobile app before, but watching 'Hello World' render on my phone felt like magic. If we can increase charging frequency by just 25%, it becomes a clear business case for charge point operators.*

*Mission objective: Prove that gamification drives measurable behavior change in EV charging habits.*

*Next phase: Begin core map functionality and establish connection to charging station data sources.*

*End log."*
