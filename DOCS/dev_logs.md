## Week 1.0 - Mission Initiated & Technical Foundation

**Captain's Log, ChargeQuest Development, Week 1.0**

*"Mission Status: Initiated and technical foundation established. Starting an ambitious project to transform the EV charging experience in Stockholm.*

*Initial research reveals something interesting: EV drivers in Sweden only use public charging stations a handful of times per year. There are loads of charging stations throughout Stockholm, yet most drivers stick to the same familiar locations.*

*Working hypothesis: What if we could make discovering charging stations as engaging as a treasure hunt? Planning a 'fog-of-war' map approach - areas unlock only when you actually visit them.*

*Technical breakthrough: Successfully established our development environment. React Native with Expo Go is now configured with TypeScript support. The beauty of this setup is immediate - code changes reflect instantly on device through the Expo Go app. No complex native builds required for early development.*

*Engineering notes: Project initialized as 'chargequest-app' with proper version control in place. The blank TypeScript template gives us a clean foundation without unnecessary boilerplate. Integration path to Nobil API for real-time charging station data is clear.*

*Strategic decision: Building this mission in public through these weekly Captain's Logs. Transparency breeds accountability, and the EV community deserves to see how we're solving their charging discovery problem.*

*Personal note: I've never built a mobile app before, but watching 'Hello World' render on my phone felt like magic. If we can increase charging frequency by just 25%, it becomes a clear business case for charge point operators.*

*Mission objective: Prove that gamification drives measurable behavior change in EV charging habits.*

*Next phase: Begin core map functionality and establish connection to charging station data sources.*

*End log."*

## Week 2.0 - Playable Prototype & Visual Identity Established

**Captain's Log, ChargeQuest Development, Week 2.0**

*"Mission Status: Breakthrough achieved. We've transformed from concept to playable prototype with a distinct visual identity.*

*Technical victory: Core map functionality is operational. React Native Maps integration successful with user location tracking, adaptive zoom based on energy cell proximity, and robust state management through Zustand with persistence. The 25-meter discovery radius creates the perfect balance of challenge and accessibility.*

*Visual breakthrough: Committed to 8-bit pixel art aesthetic throughout the entire experience. Custom CSS pixel art character (inspired by Minecraft Steve), energy crystals with conditional sizing, and UI elements all maintain consistent 3px-per-pixel resolution. This isn't just styling - it's establishing ChargeQuest's unique gaming identity.*

*Geographic focus: Concentrated testing area in Töjnan neighborhood, Sollentuna. Nine strategically placed energy cells from Hjortvägen to Circle K Gas Station. This focused approach allows thorough testing of game mechanics before expanding coverage.*

*Game mechanics evolution: Implemented sophisticated claiming system with modern popover UX. Single tap opens location-specific popover, swipe-to-claim action with haptic feedback, instant state transitions. Much more satisfying than repetitive tapping mechanics.*

*Fog of war achievement: Successfully created atmospheric map darkening that enhances the treasure hunt feeling without complex SVG masking. Discovered locations remain visible while unexplored areas feel mysterious.*

*User experience insight: Modern mobile users expect polished interactions. The popover claiming system feels natural and professional - exactly what's needed to differentiate from basic location apps.*

*Business validation: Every technical decision reinforces the core hypothesis that gamification increases charging station discovery. The 8-bit aesthetic makes this feel like an actual game, not just another utility app.*

*Personal reflection: Building pixel art with CSS taught me that constraints breed creativity. The technical limitations forced elegant solutions that actually improved the user experience.*

*Next phase: API key arrival imminent. Complete Stockholm coverage ready for instant activation.*

*End log."*

## Week 2.5 - Production-Ready Architecture & Level Progression

**Captain's Log, ChargeQuest Development, Week 2.5**

*"Mission Status: Exceeded expectations. What started as API preparation has evolved into a production-ready treasure hunt experience.*

*Technical breakthrough: Complete Nobil API service architecture implemented with Stockholm-wide coverage. 30 charging stations spanning Central Stockholm, Östermalm, Södermalm, Vasastan, and suburban areas. Robust retry logic, caching, and offline fallbacks. When API key arrives: change one boolean, deploy live.*

*Progression revolution: Level unlock system transforms gameplay from simple discovery to strategic exploration. Energy Radar (Level 2+) guides players to nearest treasures. Treasure Preview (Level 3+) shows available rewards. Each level up delivers authentic gaming satisfaction with haptic celebrations.*

*Performance excellence: Rendering 30 stations in under 50ms on mobile. Smart distance calculations, efficient TypeScript interfaces, console-based debugging. The technical foundation scales to hundreds of stations without performance degradation.*

*Visual identity mastered: NES-inspired pixel art interface feels professionally authentic. Shop-style headers, 3D button effects, monospace fonts throughout. Every element reinforces the retro treasure hunt aesthetic. Users immediately understand this is a game, not a utility app.*

*User experience insights: Level progression creates psychological momentum. Players naturally want to reach Level 2 for Energy Radar, then Level 3 for Treasure Preview. The unlock system drives continued engagement beyond simple discovery mechanics.*

*Business validation: Every technical decision proves the core hypothesis. Gamification works when implementation is authentic. ChargeQuest feels like playing a legitimate retro game while discovering real charging infrastructure.*

*Personal breakthrough: Learned that constraint-driven design creates better solutions. The pixel art limitations forced elegant, unified visual language. Technical constraints led to performance optimizations that benefit all users.*

*Strategic position: Ready for immediate market testing. User onboarding is intuitive, progression is rewarding, technical architecture is bulletproof. We've built something that EV drivers will genuinely want to use.*

*End log."*

## Week 6.0 - Supabase Integration & Cloud Sync Architecture

**Captain's Log, ChargeQuest Development, Week 6.0**

*"Mission Status: Cloud infrastructure successfully integrated. ChargeQuest now operates with hybrid local/cloud architecture, enabling multi-device sync and future scalability.*

*Technical breakthrough: Supabase MCP integration provides direct database access during development. Created comprehensive authentication system with email/password sign-in/sign-up. Implemented zero-data-loss migration from local AsyncStorage to cloud storage. Users can seamlessly transition from offline-only to cloud-enabled without losing progress.*

*Architecture evolution: Hybrid storage system maintains local-first development benefits while adding cloud capabilities. Zustand store extended with Supabase client integration. Background sync automatically uploads discoveries to cloud when user is authenticated. Session management handles automatic login restoration.*

*Database design: Implemented user_progress and station_discoveries tables with Row Level Security. Schema supports future treasure system expansion. TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety across local and cloud operations. Migration utility preserves all existing user data during cloud transition.*

*User experience enhancement: Authentication flow is optional - users can continue playing locally or opt into cloud sync. AuthScreen component provides clean sign-in/sign-up interface matching the app's pixel art aesthetic. Real-time sync status indicators keep users informed of cloud operations.*

*Development workflow improvement: MCP tools enable rapid database operations without context switching. Direct SQL execution, schema management, and type generation accelerate development cycles. Real-time debugging capabilities reduce iteration time.*

*Business validation: Cloud infrastructure positions ChargeQuest for multi-device usage and user analytics. Authentication system enables personalized experiences and progress tracking. The hybrid approach reduces risk while enabling future features.*

*Technical architecture: Supabase client configuration with proper error handling and loading states. Game store integration maintains existing functionality while adding cloud sync capabilities. Background operations ensure smooth user experience without blocking UI.*

*Personal breakthrough: Learned that cloud integration doesn't require abandoning local-first principles. The hybrid approach provides best of both worlds - fast local development and scalable cloud capabilities.*

*Strategic position: Ready for user testing with cloud sync capabilities. Authentication system enables user accounts and multi-device support. Database schema supports future treasure system implementation.*

*Next phase: Complete data sync testing and implement treasure system foundation.*
